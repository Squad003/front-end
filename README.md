# Chundlr Front

A content managment system that enables users, upon signing up and in to
see their dashboard where they can see, add, edit, and delete blog posts
and pages. For those who aren't users of the application or aren't signed
in, they can see all users blog posts and pages

## Technologies

Chundlr is built with a Node-based backend and a Mondo Database.

## Approach

Squad 003 began the project by dividing and conquering. While Kevin and Suja
worked on creating a back-end that could sustain blogposts and pages, Stanley
and Alex worked on the front-end capabilites of authorization. Once this was
through, we all went ahead and focused on the end product. We began
"quad-programming" or programming in in our group of four.
This reduced errors and communication breakdowns. We made simple
ajax calls and event handlers to process creating new blogposts
and then tackled the same approach for pages. We then focused
on creating a user experience that made sense with the remaining time provided.

## Difficulties

As a squad we struggled to grasp Git and how to effectively used it in a group.
Ultimately, we took several hours on day one of project week to master how to
Git in a group which ultimately was well worth it. We managed to make it
through the week with practically no git issues.

We also struggled to be able to determine what views would like in regards
to other users pages and posts. We focused on the question, "how do we make it
so everyone can see all posts without being signed in?" We had built an
elaborate `if` statement to resolve this when it was really just a matter
of routing things properly.

We had the stretch goal of enabling usernames which would have solved several
problems such as hiding users emails and allowing for searchbar functionality.
We also had the stretch goal of having user URLs, i.e.,
squad003.github.io/front-end/<your-username> but we were unable to make it to
this point.


## User Stories
